# Cybersecurity Exploration and Data Insights

## Overview

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Exploration and Data Insights project! This self-initiated endeavor combines data analysis and machine learning to unveil valuable insights into cybersecurity threats. Leveraging diverse datasets, including CVSS, BitcoinHeist, and Sakila, we explore unsupervised learning, clustering, and ransomware prediction.

## Datasets

### CVSS Data
- Explore vulnerabilities and risks.
- Perform unsupervised learning for risk assessment.

### BitcoinHeist
- Analyze Bitcoin transaction graphs.
- Predict ransomware presence using k-nearest neighbors and decision trees.

### Sakila
- Sharpen SQL skills with the Sakila database.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `data/`: Dataset files, including CVSS, BitcoinHeist, and Sakila.
- `img/`: Folder for storing images, including diagrams and visualizations.

## Instructions

1. Explore relevant datasets in the `data/` directory.
2. Navigate to `notebooks/` for detailed analyses.
3. Execute SQL queries in the Sakila database for SQL proficiency practice.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)
